A web application for language learners that want to practice their listening, grammar, and vocabulary. Users can create subtitled videos that contain embedded information about vocabulary and grammar, as well as links to definitons (e.g. grammar explanations or 네이버 사전).

This is also a way for me to improve my Javascript, Python, and HTML/CSS. Please excuse the UI, it's incredibly hacked together at the moment.

TOOD
----
* Youtube integration (last, as this requires that the application be deployed on the web)
* Completely rework UI
* Show current time in detail timebar
* Buttons for:
  * Return to current segment beginning
  * Go to previous/next segment
  * Slide segment back 1/2 segment size
* Get create/upload capabilities working
* Fix viewing - broken after refactoring from old create page
